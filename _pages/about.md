Hi! I'm **Shou-Yi, Hung**, and you can also call me **Ray**. I was born in Taichung, Taiwan, but grew up in Xiamen, Fujian, China. I can speak English, Chinese, a little bit of Taiwanese Hokkien, and a little bit of Japanese! 

Education
======
I'm studying at the University of Toronto, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics.  

Some of the important courses that I have taken includes: 

Operating Systems, Computer Networking Systems, Deep Learning, Probabilistic Learning, Web Programming, Software Design, Software Engineering, Computer Vision, Data Structures & Algorithms, Algorithms Design & Analysis, Systems Programming, Computer Organization, Relational Databases, Linear Programming

Interests
======
My research interest currently lies in large language models, machine learning, and data processing. I am interested in the different applications that machine learning can be applied on to make our lives easier from day to day. Furthermore, I am interested to also discover any more optimal way that we can be using large language models, ranging from more efficient training to model interpretability. 

My other interest lies in software engineering, which is reflected by my different projects that I have accomplished througout the years. I am extremely excited when I have the opportunity to build something that really makes an impact for myself and also the community around me. More details about this can be found in my [portfolio page](./portfolio)

Internship Experiences
======

I'm currently working as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services Vancouver, working under the EventBridge team. 

Previously worked at Huawei Canada as a Machine Learning Researcher Intern at the Noah's Ark Lab for 12 months. I was focused on Large Language Model researches, including model quantization and synthetic data generation for model training. Most of the time, I worked on research related works, that is, running experiments, reading papers, presenting ideas, etc. However, sometimes, I also get assigned deliverable works, which involves training models that can be deployed either on the cloud or edge devices.  

Academic Research Experiences
======
I have had the pleasure to be supervised by [Prof. En-Shiun Annie Lee](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ealee/public/) as an **NLP research student**, where I was given numerous tasks, ranging from conducting statistical analysis to assisting in writing up research papers. 

Together, we have published a few papers, publications can be found under the [publications page](./publications). 

Aside from my NLP research experience, I've also had experience working as an operating systems research volunteer under the supervision of [Prof. Kuei (Jack) Sun](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sunk/), where I signed up as a volunteer to develop features for a toy operating system (like Stanford's PintOS) written in **Rust**, named [KidneyOS](https://github.com/KidneyOS/KidneyOS). In the end, I completed parts of the Pool Allocator for memory management, and a little bit of ELF Header Verifications.
