PUMP is a course that is targetted for students prior to their first year in the University of Toronto. It focuses on basic algebra and pre-calculus concepts. 

It has different levels, PUMP I, PUMP II, and PUMP Self Guided. I TA-ed for the Self Guided version of it. 

I held office hours 2 days a week, and answered inquiries from students.
