Many endangered languages are at risk of extinction due to barriers in communication and generational gaps that hinder their preservation. A cause for languages becoming endangered is the lack of language educational tools and artificial intelligence (AI) models for these low-resource languages. To address this, we propose the ATAIGI learning app designed with AI-powered models leveraging multimodal generative techniques. Our app offers users a comprehensive learning experience by providing translated phrases and definitions, example sentences, illustrative images, romanized pronunciation, and audio speech to accelerate language learning. ATAIGI is built on five AI models that are rigorously benchmarked individually, with our Transliteration Model achieving state-of-the-art results for Taiwanese Hokkien transliteration. ATAIGI is available for all to learn the endangered language of Taiwanese Hokkien, an endangered language spoken in Taiwan. A human evaluation conducted demonstrates the effectiveness of ATAIGI in improving language proficiency and cultural understanding, supporting its potential for the preservation and education of endangered languages like the Taiwanese Hokkien.
