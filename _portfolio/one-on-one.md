This is my course final project for CSC309 (Introduction to Web Programming) at University of Toronto. 

Led a group of 4 members to build a full stack application used to schedule meetings, with database stored using SQLite. 

It was temporarily deployed to Amazon EC2, but now it is disabled as it costs money.
