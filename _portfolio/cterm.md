A simple terminal appplication that I wrote right after I took the course in systems programming (CSC209 at University of Toronto). 

Written in C, looked up a lot of tutorials on how to change terminal output colors. Configured to work for both pure Linux environment (that uses bash) and ZShell, on Mac.
