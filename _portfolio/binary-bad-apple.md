A script written in Python to convert the video "Bad Apple" into a display with only 1s and 0s. It can be used to convert any video into 1s and 0s as well. 

This is done through grayscaling the video's frames, then replacing the values with either 1 or 0, then concatenating each frame back. 

Looked up on a lot of tutorials to run `ffmpeg` and `opencv` (didn't take computer vision course at the time), and found a lot of fun in converting the video.
