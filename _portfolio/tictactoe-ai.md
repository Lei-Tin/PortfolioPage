Recreated the game Tic Tac Toe with Python. Using a CSV to store all the games that it has experienced and store the results of every possible move at any given time. Then, the AI picks the play with the highest possible win rate given the current state. 

It is a rule based AI that will evolve through time (as it has learned more ways the game can play out). The winrate of this AI increases over time if we let it play with itself using exploration strategy (trying to look for new ways that it hasn't played yet), as shown below.
