This is a course project for the course CSC258 (Computer Organization). 

We aim to recreate the classic game "Breakout" using MIPS Assembly. Projected coded using MARS Emulator, Version 4.5. 

The game is also available to run on EMARS, which is written by [Azalea](https://github.com/hykilpikonna), a really talented student in the same offering for my CSC258. 

# Features implemented

## Easy Features

- Support multiple lives (3 lives in total)
- Sound effects for collision with paddle, brick, "unbreakable" bricks, and losing the game. 
- Allows the user to pause the game by pressing "p"
- Add "Unbreakable" bricks
- Allow the player to launch the ball at the beginning of each attempt (You can use "a" and "d" to move the paddle around, pressing "space" launches the ball)

## Hard Feature

- Requires the brick to be hit for multiple times before breaking
