This is a course project for the course CSC207 (Software Design). 

Co-Lead a group of 8 people, focused mainly on applying **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID Principles**, and **Design Patterns** to the final project, and ensuring database connectivities work. We have implemented **Singleton**, **Strategy**, and **Builder** design patterns. 

The final software designed was a fully functional bill recording application written in Java 17, with GUI written using Java Spring. 

Was responsible for figuring out the deployment of a MySQL database using Microsoft Azure, and connectivity components using JDBC in the bill recording software. 

The GitHub link is available [here](https://github.com/CSC207-2022F-UofT/course-project-bill-gates). I have a fork of the repo at my GitHub as well, but it is behind by a little bit.
