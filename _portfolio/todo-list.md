One of the first websites I have made. 

A very simple website that only focuses on implementing a very simple feature of a To-Do List. The list is stored at your browser's cache, so it doens't work across devices. 

The GitHub link is available [here](https://github.com/Lei-Tin/ToDoList)

The deployment is available [here](https://lei-tin.github.io/ToDoList/).
