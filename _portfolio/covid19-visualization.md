Participated in a group of 4 for a final course project for CSC110 (Foundations of Computer Science I). 

Worked with a few members, one friend worth mentioning is [Scott](https://github.com/ScottCTD), who taught me how to use Git and a lot more. 

A fully functional GUI tool to view the COVID19 data at the time. Using data from Johns Hopkins University and UNESCO to plot, and trying to find the correlations between COVID19 cases and global school closures.
