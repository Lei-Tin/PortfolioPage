My attempt for speedrunning Hello World in C is available [here](https://youtu.be/eTrYP3OegZ4). 

My attempt for speedrunning Hello World in Python is available [here](https://youtu.be/fmn7O-a_fic). 

The video is edited using Adobe Premiere, the background music used is "Trance Music for Racing Game" by Bobby Cole.
