This is my course final project for CSC301 (Introduction to Software Engineering) at University of Toronto. 

It is a Slack bot that can be integrated into any Slack workspace, with a main feature to send kudos to other colleagues to credit their accomplishments. You can send kudos related to a certain corporation value, and these pre-established values are decided by the workspace owners and administrators. 

It was temporarily deployed to Microsoft Azure as a docker app but now it is disabled as it costs money. The database using PostgreSQL was also deployed on Microsoft Azure. A web server containing the PHP installation script was also hosted using Microsoft Azure, with OAuth2 verification procedures following the standard Slack application install procedure.
